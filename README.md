**Skills Involved:**

* Dynamic Arrays
* Visualizations (Charts)
* Data Validation
* Worksheet & Workbook Protection
<br><br>


You can select any **job title of your choice** and get the answers to the following questions, which the Basic Dashboard is trying to answer. Please note, for the sake of reference, that I am using **Data Analyst as the job role** to answer the questions. Plus, this dataset has been transformed to include only **data from 2024**.

## Power Dashboard

</div>
<br><br>

**Skills Involved:**

* Pivot Tables
* Pivot Charts
* Power Query
* M Language
* DAX

This dashboard uses **slicers and timelines** and hence offers more **detailed answers** over the previous dashboard. I really recommend you check out the dashboard. It answers most of the questions answered previously, plus a **few questions on skills**.

Please note that, as previously mentioned, this dashboard also uses **data from 2024**. Plus, as stated in the README file under Salary Dataset, this dashboard uses **Power Query to fetch the dataset remotely**, so any new changes will be updated at the click of a button, performing **ETL operations**.
