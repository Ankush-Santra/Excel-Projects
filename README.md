Skills Involved:

* Pivot Tables

This dashboard uses **slicers and timelines** and hence offers more **detailed answers** over the previous dashboard. I really recommend you check out the dashboard. It answers most of the questions answered previously, plus a **few questions on skills**.

Please note that, as previously mentioned, this dashboard also uses **data from 2024**. Plus, as stated in the README file under Salary Dataset, this dashboard uses **Power Query to fetch the dataset remotely**, so any new changes will be updated at the click of a button, performing **ETL operations**.
